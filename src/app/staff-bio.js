                Dr. Emeka Ike grew up in Nigeria and graduated with a medical degree from
                Abia State University. He further honed his medical expertise by training
                in various hospitals across the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia
                as an advanced psychiatry registrar. Seeking a sea change, Dr. Emeka
                transitioned to general practice in the beautiful town of Tumbarumba,
                where he served the community for seven years. During this time, he gained
                a broad range of experience in rural general practice, including chronic
                disease management, acute and inpatient care, aged care, and procedural
                skills

                General Practitioners (RACGP) and holds an advanced certificate in skin
                cancer medicine and a master's degree in public health. His dedication to
                mental health is evident in his registration to provide detailed mental
                health assessments and psychological therapy
              </p>

              <p class="text">
                Dr. Emeka values the privilege of practicing medicine and ensures his
                patients have ample time to share their personal health stories. He adopts
                an individualized care approach, listens carefully, and tailors treatment
                plans to help patients manage their unique health situations. Outside of
                work, Dr. Emeka loves spending time with his wife and two children,
                engaging in charity work, especially for the underprivileged, and tending
                to his vegetable garden. He is excited to start a new adventure in
                Tocumwal

                underprivileged, and those struggling in life makes him a valuable asset
                to the community.
