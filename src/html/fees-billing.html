					At Doctors@Tocumwal, we are a bulk billing clinic, ensuring accessible
					healthcare for our community. However, certain specialized procedures
					and consultations are privately billed, as the Medicare rebate does
					not fully cover the costs of providing these services. Payment is
					required in full on the day of service for these privately billed
					items.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					If you have any questions regarding fees before your visit, please
					speak with our reception team for more details.
