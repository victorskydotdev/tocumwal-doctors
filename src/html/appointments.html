				<h3 class="heading">Appointments</h3>

				<p class="text">
					At Doctors@Tocumwal, we are committed to providing high-quality,
					patient-centered care. All consultations are by appointment only, and
					we encourage you to book in advance to secure your preferred time.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					Appointments can be made by calling (insert contact number) or
					visiting the practice in person.
				</p>

				<p class="text">Some consultations may require extra time, such as:</p>

				<ul class="list-wrap">
					<li class="list">Health assessments &amp; care plans</li>

					<li class="list">Antenatal check-ups</li>

					<li class="list">Cervical screening tests (pap smears)</li>
					<li class="list">Chronic disease management reviews</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="text">
					If you think you may need an extended appointment, please let our
					reception team know when booking, so we can allocate sufficient time
					with your doctor.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					We strive to run on schedule, but unexpected emergencies or complex
					cases may occasionally cause delays. If you’re concerned about waiting
					times, feel free to call ahead for an update.
				</p>

			<div class="text-wrap animate-element">
				<h3 class="heading">Reminders</h3>
				<h4 class="sub-heading">SMS Appointment Reminders</h4>

				<p class="text">
					To help you keep track of your healthcare, we send SMS reminders
					before your appointment. While this is a courtesy service, please
					ensure we have your correct mobile number, as we cannot be responsible
					for undelivered or delayed messages.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					If you prefer not to receive SMS reminders, please inform reception.
					Missed SMS reminders do not exempt patients from attending their
					appointments.
				</p>

				<h4 class="sub-heading">Health &amp; Preventative Care Reminders</h4>

				<p class="text">
					At Doctors@Tocumwal, we take a proactive approach to your health. Our
					system may send reminders when you are due for:
				</p>

				<ul class="list-wrap">
					<li class="list">Routine health checks</li>

					<li class="list">
						Screenings (e.g., cervical screening, diabetes checks)
					</li>

					<li class="list">Vaccinations &amp; immunisations</li>

					<li class="list">Chronic disease reviews</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="text">
					These reminders help ensure you receive the best ongoing care. If you
					would rather not receive health reminders, please let us know.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="text-wrap animate-element">
				<h3 class="heading">Prescriptions (Scripts)</h3>

				<p class="text">
					We offer both paper and electronic prescriptions (eScripts) for your
					convenience. If you opt for an eScript, it can be sent directly to
					your mobile phone via SMS or email.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					Lost your script? Pharmacies across Australia now have access to the
					Active Script List (ASL), which securely stores your prescriptions.
					You will need to give your pharmacy permission to access this. Please
					check with your pharmacist if you need assistance.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					For safety reasons, repeat prescriptions may require a doctor’s
					review. Please allow enough time for script requests so you don’t run
					out of essential medication.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="text-wrap animate-element">
				<h3 class="heading">Test Results &amp; Follow-Ups</h3>

				<p class="text">
					We understand that test results are an important part of your
					healthcare. To ensure the best care and proper medical advice, all
					results must be discussed with your doctor in an appointment.
				</p>

				<ul class="list-wrap">
					<li class="list">
						Reception staff cannot provide results over the phone for privacy
						reasons.
					</li>

					<li class="list">
						If your doctor arranges for results to be sent via SMS or another
						method, they will let you know during your consultation.
					</li>

					<li class="list">
						If you have not heard from us within the expected timeframe, do not
						assume your results are normal—please contact the clinic for
						follow-up.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="sub-heading">Confidentiality &amp; Privacy</h4>

				<p class="text">
					Test results are strictly confidential and will only be provided to
					the patient, unless prior written consent is given to share them with
					a nominated person.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text">Need to Book or Have a Question?</h4>

				<p class="text">
					Call <a href="tel:0348115007">0348115007</a> to schedule an
					appointment or speak with our team.
				</p>

				<p class="text">
					At Doctors@Tocumwal, your health is our priority. Thank you for
					trusting us with your care.
